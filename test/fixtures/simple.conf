# How to run the application
script

    # Abort if some part of this script fails
    set -e

## Optional: alternative logging configuration
#    # Temporary fifo for sending log output to
#    mkfifo /tmp/strong-pm-log-fifo
#
#    # A logger instance that pipes the fifo to syslog
#    ( logger -t strong-pm </tmp/strong-pm-log-fifo & )
#
#    # Redirect the current process's stdout to the logger
#    exec >/tmp/strong-pm-log-fifo
#
#    # Clean up the fifo so we don't leave it laying around
#    rm /tmp/strong-pm-log-fifo

    # Run our actual application
    #  - exec used instead of setuid, see comment above
    #  - stderr redirection is done last so that we don't lose error messages
    #    related to the Upstart config itself
    # Uncomment and use this line if you are using an older version of Upstart
    #exec su -m -s /bin/sh -c 'exec "$0" "$@"' nobody -- /usr/local/bin/node /Users/ryan/work/strong-service-upstart/index.js 2>&1
